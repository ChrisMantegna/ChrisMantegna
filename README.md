# Hi there, I'm Chris 🐚

Welcome to my GitHub! I’m a molecular marine ecologist, educator, and interdisciplinary researcher focused on coastal ecosystems, contaminant science, and community-centered conservation. My work lives at the intersection of science, education, and equity — with a special fondness for tide pool creatures and stories from the sea.

## 🌊 What I’m Working On

- 🐙 **Contaminant Impact Research**  
  Investigating how pollution affects intertidal organisms using biomarkers and field-collected mussels in Puget Sound.

- 🧬 **eDNA + Community Composition**  
  Using environmental DNA to explore biodiversity in a pristine island preserve and monitor ecological change over time.

- 📚 **Intertidal Innovators**  
  Designing curriculum that blends marine ecology with identity exploration for high school students — because science is better with community.

## 🛠️ Tools & Skills

- **Languages & Analysis**: R, BASH and a smidge of SQL  
- **Spatial & Data Tools**: QGIS, mapping & stats in R  
- **Focus Areas**: Community ecology, science communication, curriculum design, environmental justice

## 🐌 Ask Me About...

- Translating field science into joyful learning
- Building equitable science programs
- Analyzing intertidal data (bonus points if it involves sea slugs 🐌 or chitons 🪨)
- Combining -omics, storytelling, and spatial data

## 🐠 A Few Fun Facts

- I believe everyone should get to experience the intertidal zone, no boots required.
- Seahorses are my favorite fish
